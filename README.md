# Homework-2-Responsive-Portifolio-

# Introduction
I have been given the task to develop a responsive personal portifolio, to be responsive to different screen sizes among other things. Below is some more information of what I experienced in carrying out this task.

## Why did I do this?
The reason why I was tasked with doing was for the purpose of testing my ability to incorporate Bootstrap within my work. In doing so I was able introduce a Navbar to my work and make sure the page layout was responsive. I was given a "mock-up" of what my pages should look like, this was helpful as it helped focus the image within my head of what I needed to do. 
 
### What I learnt
I learned how to use Bootstrap in my work, more specifically "the grid system". I believe I did this successfully, atleast I hope I have. This was good as it helped me lay out the page as I wanted, to make it responsive. Also I learned how to create links through the Navbar to other pages within the portifolio, which turned into a toggle menu to repsond to the change in screen size. 

#### For the future
I would like to incorporate more CSS in future portifolios to make them more user friendly. On top of this when I'm more comforable with the "grid system" I would like to experiment with it more, to see what else I can do.
